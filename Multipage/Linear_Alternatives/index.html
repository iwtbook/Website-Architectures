      <h1>Linear with Alternatives - Multipage</h1>
      <p>This website is similar to the navigation of a pure linear website in that you will still have to go through
        most every page to reach the last one, but this style gives you options here and there. It's helpful to think of
        this style as a quiz, where everyone receives the same questions, but in between questions you might see a
        certain
        page based on your answer.
